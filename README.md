# Web-Practice
Welcome to my Web Development Practice repository! This is where I store all the projects and code snippets Iâ€™ve worked on as part of my journey to learn and master web development. The goal of this repository is to showcase the fundamental concepts I am learning, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web design principles.
