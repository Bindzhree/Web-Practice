# Web-Practice
Welcome to my Web Development Practice repository! This is where I store all the projects and code snippets I’ve worked on as part of my journey to learn and master web development. The goal of this repository is to showcase the fundamental concepts I am learning, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web design principles.

I’m a beginner in web development, and this is where I’m keeping track of everything I’m learning and working on. Right now, I’m focusing on the basics: HTML and CSS, and I’m starting to explore JavaScript. This repository contains all my mini-projects, exercises, and code snippets that I’ve created as I learn.

What’s Inside:
HTML and CSS Projects: These are the first web pages I’ve built. I’m practicing creating the basic structure of web pages using HTML and styling them with CSS. Most of these projects are simple static pages where I’m learning layout techniques and design principles.

Responsive Design: I’m learning how to make my websites look good on different devices, like phones, tablets, and computers. This means making sure that the pages adjust and look nice on any screen size using CSS media queries.

Mini Projects: I’m doing small practice projects to help me learn and understand web development concepts. These include simple things like building a basic webpage or creating a form.

My Learning Goals:
Get Comfortable with HTML and CSS: My main focus right now is learning HTML to build the structure of web pages and CSS to style them and make them look good. I want to practice and get better at creating layouts, adding colors, and working with text and images.

Start Learning JavaScript: I’ve just started learning JavaScript, and I’m excited to add interactivity to my websites. Right now, I’m working on small tasks like making buttons do things or showing messages when a user clicks.

Improve My Web Design Skills: I want to learn how to design websites that look good and are easy to use. I’m starting with the basics like Flexbox and Grid to make my layouts more flexible and responsive.

Technologies I’m Using:
HTML5: This is the language I’m using to create the structure and content of web pages.
CSS3: This is the language I’m using to style the pages and make them look nice, including things like colors, fonts, and layout.
JavaScript (Starting Soon): I’m just beginning with JavaScript, and soon I’ll be adding small features like interactivity and animations to my pages.
Git/GitHub: I’m using Git to track my progress, and GitHub to store my projects and share them with others.
